# kallisto
A reimplementation of (most of) kallisto, an RNA sequence quantification tool. Worked on as a group project for stat590.

To run this program, first run Binary_convert.c to convert the FASTA files into binary files. Note that the data used for this project is not included in this repository, but your own data could be used. Our data was stored in a folder called simdata. Finally, run kallisto.c to calculate the relative abundance of each transcript.

See the PDF for a more in depth explanation of the program as well as the theory and equations behind it.
